## Guest Wish List

### Make a Guest equivalent to a Member
As an owner, I would like to be able to give a Guest the same capabilities as a Member, because then my long list of wants specific to Guests would probably go away and it would probably make it a lot simpler to implement than all of these one-off features for guests. This would probably be easier for most users to understand as well.  More granular settings can be in an advanced settings section.  We want to collaborate without handcuffs!

  - Project level setting that gives ALL Guests the same capability as Members.
  - User level setting that gives a Guest the same capability as a Member. 

### Guest - Granular Settings

### Scheduling
I want to be able to schedule a meeting in a channel via Outlook. This could be done by adding the channel's email ID to the invite.  Currently, meeting invites are just treated like any other email.
I want team members to be able to opt in to share their calendar availability so that meetings can be scheduled more easily.

### Meeting Minutes
I would like to use OneNote for meeting minutes and them be searchable via Teams.
I would like to have organization of meeting recordings and minutes that occurred in a channel. Maybe a calendar view tab in the channel.
